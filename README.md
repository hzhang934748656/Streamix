Streamix is a video conferencing feature that provides you seamless virtual background matting regardless of your surroundings and provides you eye gaze correction thus giving you a feeling of a natural face to face interaction. We have used python to develop virtual background mating model and we are using ReactJS and NodeJS to build a webapp where you can see the power of our algorithms.
